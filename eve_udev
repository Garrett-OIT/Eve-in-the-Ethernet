eve_udev - rough pseudocode for Eve's udev rule for removable media storage

if isUSB()
    mount USB
    future extension goal: check authentication
        this would prevent the glaring security flaw (theoretically) that's introduced

    if bpf.py
        cp /dev/sdx/bpf.py ~/bpf.py or somewhere
    if bpf.c
        cp /dev/sdx/bpf.c ~/bpf.c or somewhere
